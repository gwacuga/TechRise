      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>We’re the tech mentors for the next generation of young builders and creators. At TechRise Initiative, teens (10-17) don’t just learn AI, coding, or cybersecurity—they use them to build apps, develop games, create digital art, analyze markets, and protect systems while mastering responsible tech use.

        Think of us as the ultimate launchpad for future-ready skills where:
         Learning feels like play – through hands-on projects in AI design, Python programming, ethical hacking & more
         Ideas meet impact – turning "what if?" into "I made this!"
        Innovation meets responsibility – creating safely in our digital world
        
        We’re shaping a generation who don’t just use technology – they understand, create, and lead it.
        Our secret? We teach like the tech industry works – through collaborative projects, real-world challenges, and constant experimentation. No boring lectures, just skills that stick.</p>
